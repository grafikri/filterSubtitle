1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Now kids, when aunt
Robin was a teenager

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,920
She was a... well...
Canadian Pop Star.

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,650
But by 2008 she was
entirely new person.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,740
Coming up next, is your
baby trying to kill you

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,500
Which made events of that
week all the more sorprising.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,460
So I go this morning and...
It's freezing.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,270
So I walk over there

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,880
and I dont why I still talking

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,310
because clearly we all
asking the same question:

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,740
What in good's creation is
going on with Robin's brest_

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,320
I know, isn't it amazing?

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,260
I spent half an hour making this
happen there's tape in there...

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,750
cotton balls, half of a Nerf
football, but it works, right?

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,720
Totally. What's the occasion?

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,520
And old friend from Canada is in town

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,020
and I'm meeting him for a drink.

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,450
Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,150
No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,750
<i>Simon. I thought he was
the coolest guy ever.</i>

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,090
<i>He smelled like Drakkar.</i>

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,190
<i>He could ollie on a skateboard.</i>

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,320
<i>He had the most amazing collection</i>

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,520
<i>of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts.</i>

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,390
<i>We spent the whole summer madly in love.</i>

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,490
Tell me more. Tell me more.

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
Like, did he have a car?

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,650
So he's the guy who...

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,190
How shall I say this like a gentleman?

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,920
Robin, did he take your maple leaf?

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,620
No, it wasn't like that.

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,250
Sounds to me like he gave you
your first "O, Canada!" face.

32
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,120
<i>This went on for a really long time.</i>

33
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,450
<i>Some of them jokes were elegant
and well-crafted...</i>

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,320
Wait, wait. Did he break up with you

35
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,150
and tell you he's just not that Inuit?

36
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,650
<i>...others were crude, and ill-formed...</i>

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,150
Um, something about fur trapping.

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,450
<i>...and others were obvious,
but needed to be said...</i>

39
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,350
Did you ride his Zamboni?

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,620
Oh! Come on! Oh!

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,950
Wait, wait, wait. Did he...?

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,750
I think I'm out.

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,960
Yeah, I'm also "oot. "

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
Okay, now I'm really out.

45
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,590
Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,650
We only dated for a week and a half.

47
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,020
Wha...? I thought you said you
were together all summer.

48
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,150
Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty
much the last week of July.

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,620
Anyway, one night,

50
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,820
his band just finish playing this gig...

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,350
Oh, my God! Simon.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,150
That was such a good show.

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,690
You guys totally rocked out.

54
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,120
Yeah.

55
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,450
I know.

56
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,720
I figure we're about four or five gigs away

57
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,020
from really exploding.

58
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,350
We're gonna be big, babe.

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,930
I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,750
So, that everything?

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,690
Yeah.

62
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,300
All right.

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,300
Listen, babe...

64
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,650
It's over.

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,320
What?

66
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,030
I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
Louise Marsh?!

68
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,950
That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.

69
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,420
Yeah, why would he want to get back
together with Louise Marsh?

70
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,790
Well, the thing is...

71
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,190
her folks just put in a pool.

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,550
Oh... So...

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,250
I totally... I get it.

74
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,220
Pools are great.

75
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,830
Swimming's awesome.

76
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,850
We have a sprinkler.

77
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,830
Run right through it.

78
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,920
Well, I should go.

79
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,360
Uh...

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,500
Babe, wait.

81
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,890
Yeah, Simon?

82
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,630
You forgot to load the drum set.

83
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,850
No!

84
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,490
Tell me you did not load the drum set.

85
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,850
I did.

86
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,090
And now he's coming here?

87
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,920
Robin, why do you want to see this guy?

88
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,450
Oh! I know why.

89
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,120
You're gonna win, aren't you?

90
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,090
I have no idea what you' talking about.

91
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,420
Yes, you do.

92
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,120
Whenever you haven't seen
someone for a long time,

93
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,720
no matter how much you want to deny it,

94
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,850
there's always a clear winner
and a clear loser.

95
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,720
Well, since you brought it up,

96
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,690
let's add up the points.

97
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,890
You're starting out with two
big ones right there.

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,350
Thank you.

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,720
Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.

100
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,690
Point Robin.

101
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,590
Um, he never became

102
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,620
a rock star.

103
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,250
Point Robin.

104
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,450
He now works at a water slide
park outside of Ottawa.

105
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,890
Point Simon.

106
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,350
Wait. Do they have a wave pool?

107
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,490
No.

108
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,620
Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip.

109
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,120
There's no coming back from that.

110
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,450
Yeah, he's going down.

111
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,100
I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter.

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
There he is.

113
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,750
<i>And sure enough, there was a clear winner,</i>

114
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,560
<i>and a clear loser.</i>

115
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,390
<i>It just wasn't clear to everybody.</i>

116
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,020
Hey, babe.

117
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,990
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,150
Okay, what the hell just happened?

119
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,790
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?

120
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,120
Hey, Simon.

121
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,050
Wow, look at you.

122
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,000
You got old.

123
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,490
Yeah.

124
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,720
You look great.

125
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,590
You got hotter,

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,320
like that's possible.

127
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,220
So...

128
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,690
Look, I know it didn't go as planned,

129
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,750
but I can't help it.

130
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,150
I mean...

131
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,500
he's still got it.

132
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,590
Whoa! Four bucks for a brew?

133
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,490
What a rip.

134
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,260
Good think I'm packing.

135
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,990
So he's not a snob.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
He's from a different part

137
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,750
of Canada, you know?

138
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,090
The maple leaf flag on the
back of the pickup truck?

139
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,090
He's Red Province.

140
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,850
He's from the Deep North.

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,120
The thing is,

142
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,120
we gave you so many opportunities.

143
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,490
So, Simon,

144
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,220
Robin's a bit of a local celebrity
here in New York.

145
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,790
She's the lead anchor at Metro News One.

146
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,090
Tell him, Robin.

147
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,350
No. It's stupid.

148
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,730
It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,090
I'm sorry, Simon.

150
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,950
Here we are nattering on
about our big celebrity.

151
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,720
What do you do for a living?

152
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,350
Oh, I work at the Splish Splash
Ottawa Water Slide Park.

153
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,290
Huh! A water slide park.

154
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,890
That sure is different than what Robin does.

155
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,430
Yeah, it is... because I save lives.

156
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,690
If I'm not sitting in that stool

157
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,320
at the top of the slide, going...

158
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,590
Go...

159
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,350
Go...

160
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,950
Go...

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
people die.

162
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,690
What, you think it's so easy?

163
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,320
You try it.

164
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,050
Um... okay.

165
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,390
Go.

166
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
You didn't put your hand up; kid just died.

167
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,520
No, I didn't know...

168
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,120
Another kid just went; he died too.

169
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,690
Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...

170
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,420
Another kid just went; now
you've got a pile-up

171
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,550
and Robin's got something
to report on the news.

172
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,920
This just in: My friend, Ted, just
killed a bunch of kids today.

173
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,390
Well, that's cool.

174
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,990
You got to pay the bills somehow

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,320
since your whole music thing didn't
really pan out, did it?

176
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,290
Well, it hasn't panned out yet,
but the band's still going.

177
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,390
About four or five gigs

178
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,490
away from really exploding.

179
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,000
The Foreskins are still playing?

180
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,090
The Foreskins?

181
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,790
How'd you guys come up with that name?

182
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,050
Well, there's four of us,

183
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,930
and we play without shirts.

184
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,750
Babe, seriously.

185
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,200
I know. I'm sorry.

186
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,820
I know. I'm sorry.

187
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,890
But you guys just don't understand.

188
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,620
<i>The fact that he kept the band
going... that's impressive.</i>

189
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,750
I mean, I gave up my musical dream.

190
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,920
Which brings us to the most important piece

191
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,420
of information from tonight.

192
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,790
So, Simon,

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,020
how did you guys meet?

194
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,290
Oh, I was in her video.

195
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,220
Starred in it is more like it.

196
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,250
Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg,

197
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,690
<i>everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.</i>

198
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm sorry. I've seen "Let's Go to the Mall"

199
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,350
about a thousand times, and
you, sir, are not in it.

200
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,790
No, I was in the other one.

201
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,400
There's another video?!

202
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,450
Robin, seriously,

203
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,320
just make this easier on yourself

204
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,620
and give us the tape.

205
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,020
No.

206
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,120
All right.

207
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,520
You leave me no choice.

208
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,690
From this moment on,

209
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,520
I will spend every waking minute
ching down this tape.

210
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,090
I will not sleep. I will not eat.

211
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,990
My life will be a living
hell of search engines

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,250
and overseas phone calls,

213
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,850
chasing down something that
possibly can't be found.

214
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,130
Okay.

215
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,550
It's just...

216
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,090
It was so hard to watch, Robin.

217
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,020
You're usually so cool.

218
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,650
I don't know what's wrong with me.

219
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,750
I'm sitting next to Simon,
and suddenly I'm 16 again.

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,020
Oh, it's actually a common thing.

221
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,550
When you're around someone from your past,

222
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,850
you kind of revert back to who you were

223
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,220
when you knew them.

224
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,750
There's not really a name for it, though.

225
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,220
It's called "revertigo. "

226
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,220
Yeah, I don't know about "revertigo. "

227
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,450
You know who gets really bad revertigo?

228
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,150
Lily when she around

229
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,820
her high school friend, Michelle.

230
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,390
Michelle? She sounds hot.

231
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,590
You don't know about Lily and Michelle?

232
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,420
No. What about Lily and Michelle?

233
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,760
Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat.

234
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,790
Hey, Lil? What?

235
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,290
You know, I was just thinking,

236
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,120
we haven't seen your friend
Michelle in a while.

237
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,220
Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call,
see if she wants to hang out.

238
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

239
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,790
What... Do they make out?

240
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,850
Better.

241
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,720
Comparable. Comparable.

242
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,660
Whatever. It's over. I lost.

243
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,090
I guess you, uh, you don't
get second chance.

244
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,420
I got a second chance.

245
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,450
What happened?

246
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,530
He came by my place tonight...

247
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,820
Simon. What are you doing here?

248
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,690
I just feel like there's
some unfinished business

249
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,400
between you and me.

250
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,950
Seeing you now...

251
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,120
has made me realize that
breaking up with you

252
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,990
is the biggest mistake I
made in my entire life.

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,430
Oh, I like where this is going.

254
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,420
I know this is crazy,

255
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,590
and I'm only in town for a couple of days,

256
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,120
but do you want to go on a date?

257
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,450
He asked you out?!

258
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,820
Oh, step into my web, Simon.

259
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,150
The coup de grace.

260
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,600
Finish him!

261
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,020
<i>I'd love to!</i>

262
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,290
Wait. You're going on a date with Simon?

263
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,490
That Simon?The one we met?

264
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,650
Robin, this guy doesn't deserve
a second chance.

265
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,190
Not after the way he treated you.

266
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,020
That was ten years ago. People evolve.

267
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,730
I mean, are you the same person
that you were in high school?

268
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,090
Oh, hell, no!

269
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,790
I think you're gonna enjoy this.

270
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,390
That my girl Michelle? Bitch, you know it!

271
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,250
How she livin'? She living
only way she know how to.

272
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,590
Large!

273
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,390
Oh, girl, you gots to get
your drink on up in here.

274
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,190
I'm hoping my t ass can hustle
me up a vodka-Gatorade.

275
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,960
For reals.

276
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,450
I want her around all the time.

277
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,820
I'd even consider not trying
to sleep with her

278
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,130
if that's what it takes.

279
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,930
Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.

280
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,950
Yeah! Guys, that was great.

281
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,590
Let's take five.

282
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,320
Hey, babe, did you like it

283
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,820
after my bass solo when I
flicked my pick at you?

284
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,020
That rocked.

285
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,690
Yeah.

286
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,950
Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.

287
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,390
Oh, uh, sure.

288
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,990
Um, I think it...

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,020
It's cool. You'll find it later. Oh, cool.

290
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,090
I wish I didn't have to go
to work in the morning.

291
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,490
Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work.

292
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,550
You got to play our demo on your show.

293
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,350
Oh, well, you know, it's not a show.

294
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,750
It's the news.

295
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,120
Right. So you can be, like,

296
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,590
"Hey, did you hear there's some news?

297
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,620
There's a rad band you guys
should check out. "

298
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,020
And then play it.

299
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,760
Or just, like, the first three songs.

300
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,890
And now it's time for "Puppy Corner,"

301
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,590
some little angels looking for a new home,

Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted.

308
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,620
Of course, a lot of the people
calling in thought

309
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,490
we were going to kill them.

310
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,750
Robin, your revertigo is really
starting to affect your work.

311
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,490
What's revertigo?

312
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,350
It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.

313
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,990
No. It's a phenomenon where,

314
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,920
when you're around people from your past,

315
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,920
you start behaving like them.

316
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,720
Oh. One example of that springs to mind.

317
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,330
I think we all know what it is.

318
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,390
You do?

319
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,090
Yeah. Ted.

320
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,390
Me?

321
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,090
Whenever Ted's friend Punchy
comes into town,

322
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,720
it's like, all of a sudden,
Ted's in high school again.

323
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,120
Okay, okay.

324
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,450
First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello,

325
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,190
and I don't do that.

326
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,030
Ooh. That must be Adam.

327
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,850
'Sup, Punchy? 'Sup, Shmosby?!

328
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,450
You want to go? I'm alrey there!

329
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,860
Come on! This is it!

330
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,520
Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.

331
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,400
Yeah, it was a real shock.

332
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,220
I can't believe you, of all
people, are saying this.

333
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,190
Why?

334
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,250
No reason.

335
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,450
Robin, the point is, what are you doing?

336
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,020
I mean, this guy?

337
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,720
Okay, you want the truth?

338
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,790
Yeah. I like Simon.

339
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,290
I do.

340
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,790
We have fun together.

341
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,550
Oh, we know you do, honey, but
we're worried about you.

342
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,720
You're worried?

343
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,020
Okay, hold on.

344
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,820
Is there any version of this conversation

345
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,050
where you guys don't sound like my parents?

346
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,020
I don't know. Is there any version

347
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,090
where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?

348
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,150
That's exactly what my mom would say.

349
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,520
No. If I was your mom, I woulsay,

350
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,550
"We forbid you from seeing this boy. "

351
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,790
Lily!

352
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,890
No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.

353
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,090
This is my life!

354
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,620
You guys just don't get it!

355
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,420
You've never felt the way that I feel!

356
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,950
Now, now. We were once young
and in love, too.

357
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,090
Yeah, like, a billion years ago.

358
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,750
You've been drinking, haven't you?

359
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,920
Yeah, we all have.

360
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,090
You bought the last round.

361
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,590
You're not going to that show tonight!

362
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,420
Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else?

363
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,950
Tonight, after the show,

364
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,590
Simon and I are going all the way!

365
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,420
Young lady, get back here!

366
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,730
Thanks for your help.

367
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,520
Hey, so, today at work...

368
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,460
Not now, Ted!

369
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,250
Geez.

370
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,590
Ooh!

371
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,020
Oh, hey, Simon.

372
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,290
Great show.

373
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,950
You guys still rock.

374
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,450
Yeah.

375
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,350
They totally dug my bass solo.

376
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,100
Man!

377
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,650
Why can't I always feel this alive?!

378
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,950
God, I just love seeing you so happy.

379
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,250
Yeah.

380
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,520
About that.

381
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,260
Listen, babe.

382
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,550
It's over. What?

383
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,790
I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.

384
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,790
What?

385
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,430
You're kidding me.

386
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,230
You're breaking up with me?

387
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,250
Again?

388
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,650
F- For the same ex-girlfriend?

389
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,850
In the same van?

390
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,890
What is it?

391
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,150
Her-Her parents got a pool?

392
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,720
Is that still the reason?

393
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,300
Well...

394
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,050
I'm sorry, Robin.

395
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,250
I'm fine, really.

396
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,350
Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real.

397
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,720
Simon's a dawg.

398
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,050
You feel me, Chelle?

399
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,650
Mm-hmm, for reals.

400
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,250
He a scrub.

401
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,620
Mm. True dat.

402
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,500
I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.

403
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,220
So, how's Columbia?

404
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,490
Great!

405
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,290
I'm almost done with my disstation.

406
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,350
Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in
behavioral psychology.

407
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,220
Um, can I make an observation?

408
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,550
Oh.

409
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,750
I know.

410
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,190
Whenever I'm around Lily,

411
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,020
she just brings out that side of me.

412
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,850
There's a psychological term
for the phenomenon.

413
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,720
Revertigo? No.

414
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,520
Actually, it's associative
regression. You see,

415
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,720
the neural pathways that...

416
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,620
*

417
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,550
Oh, no, you did not just

418
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,750
put on my jam!

419
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,620
Oh. Put your hands up, girl!

420
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,860
Holla! Holla!

421
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,030
<i>One by one, we all had to go home.</i>

422
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,330
<i>Soon, it was just Robin.</i>

423
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,550
All right.

424
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,090
I can't find your video.

425
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,750
I've wasted three days tr...

426
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,090
*

427
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,090
What's the matter?

428
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,950
*

429
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,920
Uh... Simon dumped me

430
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,590
in his van after the show.

431
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,750
Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.

432
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,520
No, tonight.

433
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,620
Ooh.

434
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,750
Really?

435
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,920
Oh! Oh, come here.

436
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,290
Come here.

437
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,720
*

438
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,990
It's just...

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,720
when I was young, I was so...

440
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,650
vulnerable and-and open to things, you know?

441
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:24,190
And... I guess I just... I wanted
to feel that way again.

442
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,320
I wanted to be 16 again.

443
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:29,320
Robin, that is the stupidest thing

444
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,890
I've ever heard come out of your mouth.

445
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,850
You want to be 16 again?

446
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,820
I have watched your first
Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times,

447
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,650
and it's not because I'm proud
of you as a friend.

448
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,250
It's because you were totally,
totally lame back then.

449
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,250
But now, come on. Pa-cow!

450
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,750
You're the most awesome person
I have ever known.

451
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,790
Well, second most awesome.

452
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,590
Right. Of course, the-the first being you.

453
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,990
No.

454
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,750
No. The first is this guy

455
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,050
who lives in a place called the mirror.

456
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,990
What up.

457
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,420
Oh.

458
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,820
I'm saying

459
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,920
that you are way more awesome
than Simon ever will be.

460
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,490
*

461
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,650
Barney, do you want to
come back to my place?

462
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,320
Your place?

463
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:23,060
*

464
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,090
Are you sure you want to do this?

465
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,190
Yeah. I am.

466
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,720
Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?

467
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,060
Of course.

468
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,790
So, should I just put it in?

469
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,830
Yeah, why not?

470
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,750
* Met you at the mall...

471
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,390
This was my big artistic follow-up

472
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,220
to"Let's Go to the Mall. "

473
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,290
It kind of tanked.

474
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,220
* My friends said I was a fool

475
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,620
<i>You're a fool. Shut up!</i>

476
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,790
Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm.

477
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,890
* 'Cause you were older and
got kicked out of school *

478
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,550
You are so rad.

479
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,890
* Together we we gonna travel the globe *

480
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,320
* From Alberta to Ontario

481
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,690
It's everything I want it to be and more.

482
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,620
Oh, I'm so glad. Mm-hmm.

483
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,220
* And now I'm building sandcastles
in the sand *

484
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,490
<i>* Sandcastles in the sand *</i>

485
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,450
* Thought I could fly when
you held my hand *

486
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,650
<i>* Thought I could fly *</i>

487
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,290
But now...

488
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,020
* Eternity returns to black and white... *

489
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,750
Is that Alan Thicke?

490
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,450
Yeah.

491
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,090
* It was the greatest week and a half *

492
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,250
* Of my life

493
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,150
* We used to go to the beach

494
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,820
You know, if you reedit it, there's
a tampon commercial in here somewhere.

495
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,790
* On our favorite bench

496
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,720
* We'd sit and talk and you
taught me to french *

497
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,420
* You're good at...

498
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,820
Do you seem how lame you were back then?

499
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,850
Yeah, you're right. I was lame.

500
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,690
Totally lame. Ugh.

501
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,950
*... so unfair...

502
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,120
You don't understand about love.

503
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,520
And, of course, the robot
makes an appearance

504
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,320
in the sad love ballad.

505
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:34,820
He was my sidekick. He had to be.

506
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,220
<i>And so they watched it again.</i>

507
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,190
* Come back, please

508
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,150
* I've changed my mind

509
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,050
* Let's go all the way

510
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,990
<i>I love you.</i>

511
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,100
Let's do it.

512
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,890
I miss you.

513
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,190
<i>And again.</i>

514
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,050
* Sandcastles may be cute

515
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,420
I'm on the pill now.

516
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,050
<i>And again.</i>

517
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,520
* But now all they do is
remind me of you... *

518
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,890
<i>They watched it over and over
that night until finally,</i>

519
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,130
<i>they stopped watching.</i>

520
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,130
