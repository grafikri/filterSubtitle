1
00:00:01,795 --> 00:00:04,614
Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.

2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:07,445
Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,845
can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.

4
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:12,713
Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,529
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,422
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

7
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:19,701
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,300
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,861
Why was this flight
so important?

10
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:28,026
Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.

11
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,606
I had just sold my first
building design and become

12
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:33,412
the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.

13
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:35,640
Suddenly I was
being headhunted.

14
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:39,217
One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.

15
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:41,369
They were flying me in
for a final interview

16
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,427
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.

17
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,379
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

18
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:46,817
It was my destiny.

19
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:48,557
There was just one problem.

20
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,686
Hi, wait, two more.

21
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,527
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

22
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,789
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

23
00:00:54,803 --> 00:00:57,729
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.

24
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,888
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

25
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,058
Except for that guy.

26
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:07,218
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

27
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:08,348
I'm sorry, sir.

28
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:10,559
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

29
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:13,888
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

30
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,068
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night

31
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,666
dreaming about being a...

32
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:20,037
I mean, uh...

33
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:22,149
This is a cool job.

34
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:24,946
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

35
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:26,339
I'll see what I can do.

36
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,737
But it doesn't look good.

37
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:28,647
Thanks.

38
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,489
Your uniforms are pretty.

41
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:50,306
Okay.

42
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:52,777
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

43
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:55,147
It's up to the captain now
and they're calling us back.

44
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,346
Great, please let us know
soon as you hear anything.

45
00:01:57,362 --> 00:01:59,587
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

46
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:02,205
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

47
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,155
not, you know,
one minute after.

48
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,838
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

49
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:08,165
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

50
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,728
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

51
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,758
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

52
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,048
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

53
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:18,936
Hello?

54
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:23,768
Oh, that is great news.

55
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,868
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

56
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,875
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

57
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,168
Where was it?

58
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:31,777
That thing better
have call waiting.

59
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:34,358
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

60
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:35,696
It's down to three people

61
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,865
and I know they need to
make their decision today.

62
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:41,256
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

63
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:44,137
I'm so stupid.

64
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:46,246
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

65
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:48,946
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

66
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,827
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

67
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,298
She had a point.

68
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,095
It was kind of Barney's fault.

69
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,885
Let's back up a few months.

70
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,495
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

71
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,096
Oh, man, it kills.

72
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,697
You want some aspirin, baby?

73
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,815
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

74
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,187
Wow, your first broken bone.

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,086
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

76
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,795
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

77
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,276
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

78
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,938
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

79
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:20,435
I can summon
incredible strength.

80
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:23,217
Ted,  tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

81
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,088
There was a really heavy door.

82
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:26,496
He opened it.

83
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,678
On one pull.

84
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,198
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

85
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:34,605
Yeah. It sucks,

86
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,985
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

87
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,928
Training for a marathon.

88
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:42,415
What?

89
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,258
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

90
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,046
You're kidding, right?

91
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:49,818
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

92
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,767
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

93
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,546
and just run the New
York City Marathon?

94
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:55,735
Absolutely.

95
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,798
Barney, we're talking
about 42 kilometers.

96
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:01,258
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

97
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,406
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

98
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:05,248
Here's how you run a marathon.

99
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,866
Step one, you start running.

100
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,117
There is no step two.

101
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:12,798
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

102
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,795
Take my number and
run in my place.

103
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,195
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

104
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:19,547
50 bucks?

105
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,438
Gee, Grandpa, if I win,

106
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:23,986
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

107
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,616
Make it $10,000.

108
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,978
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

109
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,455
Fine, then no bet.

110
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:31,937
Okay, $50.

111
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,706
The next morning,
as the marathon began,

112
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:38,905
we were focused on
Marshall's computer.

113
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:41,475
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

114
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:44,487
see  when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

115
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,446
Ooh, he's starting!

116
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:48,395
This ought to be good.

117
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:54,806
Wow.

118
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,928
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

119
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:00,336
This tracking thing is amazing.

120
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:02,696
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

121
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,465
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

122
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,575
He's gotta be cheating, okay.

123
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:14,798
He knew we'd check.

124
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,417
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

125
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:19,877
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

126
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:22,488
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

127
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,925
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

128
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,177
and up First Avenue within
the next hour or so. But...

129
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,726
there is no way that
that's really him.

130
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,206
It's  really him.

131
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,825
Hey! That's mine.

132
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,936
Yeah, you'd better run!

133
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:51,115
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

134
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,465
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

135
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,307
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

136
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:58,295
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

137
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,867
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

138
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,068
I won.

139
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,656
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

140
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,928
So where's my 50 bucks?

141
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,216
All right.

142
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,216
I got to admit,
you earned this.

143
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:19,015
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

144
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,015
Anyway, I'm heading home.

145
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,971
Might go hit the gym.

146
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,869
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get

147
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,598
to use the subway
for free today.

148
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:30,966
Wow. You know I really should
check out this "subway."

149
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:32,338
Heard so much about it.

150
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,717
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

151
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,575
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

152
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:40,068
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

153
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,167
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

154
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,506
No.

155
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:48,735
So Barney did it.

156
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,195
He actually finished
the marathon.

157
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,647
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.

158
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,357
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

159
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,787
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

160
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,525
What, what are
you talking about?

161
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,437
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

162
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:09,927
Finisher.

163
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:13,056
Yeah, you know what I mean.

164
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,055
86th street.

165
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,906
My legs don't work.

166
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,935
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

167
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,027
I've seen where
it turns around.

168
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,518
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

169
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,126
Barney's legs won't work.

170
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,745
He's riding the subway
from end to end

171
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,918
because he physically
can't get off the train.

172
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,908
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

173
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,366
Listen to me, Ted.

174
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:01,366
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

175
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,687
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

176
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,607
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

177
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:08,728
All right. I'll be right there.

178
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,286
Stay where you are.

179
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,146
Ted, Ted.

180
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,517
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

181
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:38,668
I'm sorry. I can't.

182
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:40,017
Douche.

183
00:08:56,426 --> 00:08:58,738
- Barney?!
- Ted!

184
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,231
Hey!

185
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:07,999
No...!

186
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:11,889
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

187
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,641
you never would have
jumped that turnstile,

188
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,681
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,

189
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,389
and we would have
made this flight.

190
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,690
You're right.

191
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,548
Everything can be
traced back to him.

192
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,490
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

193
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,220
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

194
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:30,231
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

195
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:33,099
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

196
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:34,509
Ma, can I call you back?

197
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

198
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

199
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,271
Looks like your
flight left already.

200
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:43,899
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

201
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,430
Well, he never even
called you back?

202
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:48,028
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

203
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:50,130
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

204
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:51,849
at a Radisson in Orlando.

205
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:59,931
It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me

206
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:02,311
to Chicago on time
for my job interview,

207
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,911
but it was all the way on the
other side of the airport.

208
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,941
What was the name of
the airline again?

209
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,798
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

210
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,920
Was the "R" backwards?

211
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,258
God, I hope not.

212
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:14,691
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

213
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,931
More like dumb carts.

214
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:19,338
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

215
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,871
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

216
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:25,180
- if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

217
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:27,361
What, you think
this is my fault?

218
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:32,841
For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.

219
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:34,879
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

220
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:38,480
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

221
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:45,178
I cannot allow this.

222
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,381
What?

223
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:51,688
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

224
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:04,301
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

225
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:07,259
two to four hours
before a big run.

226
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:09,639
Try a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

227
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,609
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

228
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:15,361
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

229
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:19,188
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

230
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:21,120
Liquids are digested faster.

231
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:23,139
That way, no energy is wasted,

232
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:25,800
and it's all about the run.

233
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:59,939
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

234
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,080
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

235
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,548
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

236
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:11,039
You are a robot sent
from the future

237
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:12,960
to win the marathon!

238
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:17,108
You are... Marshall.

239
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:20,901
You are... Marshall.

240
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:25,111
You are Marshall! Yeah!

241
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:34,361
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

242
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:37,990
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

243
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:41,908
Try using some petroleum
jelly on the affected areas."

244
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,281
Oh, gosh!

245
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,689
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

246
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:25,660
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

247
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:27,701
You're the best.

248
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,889
You look good.

249
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,850
Nobody does it better than you.

250
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,500
Marshall? Oh, my God!

251
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:39,128
So, yes, it was your fault.

252
00:13:39,146 --> 00:13:41,408
I mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

253
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,100
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

254
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,969
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

255
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,228
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

256
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,111
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

257
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:54,901
That really wasn't my fault.

258
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:57,460
I wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

259
00:13:57,474 --> 00:13:58,871
Hey, think about it.

260
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:00,878
Hey, what's going on here?

261
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,929
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.

262
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:04,261
Yeah, but for what?

263
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,501
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

264
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:08,230
to give you some indication.

265
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:11,058
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

266
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:14,228
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

267
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:16,300
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

268
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,439
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

269
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:22,599
We have to camp out.

270
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,479
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

271
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,900
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

272
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:28,898
but I never knew where it was.

273
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:32,509
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

274
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,778
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

275
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,969
- What thing?
- A penis.

276
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:40,881
-  This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

277
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:43,968
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

278
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,248
Vera Wang!

279
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:49,330
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

280
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:51,089
You said wang.

281
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:57,500
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

282
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,308
Only fewer mullets.

283
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:04,099
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

284
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:09,039
Ooh, this is comfy.

285
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,511
We might actually
be able to sleep.

286
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,611
That's  kind of annoying.

287
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:18,879
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

288
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:33,518
I don't think I can take this.

289
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,980
Every time it turns off,
I think,

290
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:38,980
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

291
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,208
but then it does.

292
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:42,738
Why does it, Robin?

293
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:44,930
Why does it keep turning on?

294
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,979
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

295
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,759
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

296
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:51,329
Why don't we sing along?

297
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:14,058
If we get through this,

298
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,541
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

299
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,851
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

300
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,149
Morning, ladies.

301
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:30,109
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

302
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,748
The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,

303
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:44,080
so while I was at work,

304
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,660
she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,

305
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:48,980
and that's when...

306
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:51,459
Nobody does it better than you.

307
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:53,119
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

308
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:57,679
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

309
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,389
we would have made
the first flight.

310
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:02,080
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

311
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:06,189
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

312
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:08,260
Oh, my God!

313
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,689
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

314
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:12,449
Yes, yes, I am.

315
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,430
I can't believe
you recognized me.

316
00:17:14,446 --> 00:17:16,838
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

317
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,168
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

318
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:22,148
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

319
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:24,391
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

320
00:17:24,403 --> 00:17:26,470
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

321
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,800
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

322
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,878
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

323
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:34,879
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

324
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,210
And  I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

325
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,910
two seats on that next flight.

326
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:44,770
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.

327
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,711
Let me see what I can find out.

328
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:49,440
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

329
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,900
I think it might hurt.

330
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,398
This is such a nightmare.

331
00:17:57,313 --> 00:18:00,529
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

332
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,840
for a wedding dress?

333
00:18:02,553 --> 00:18:03,638
No.

334
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,661
Wait. It goes back further.

335
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:08,611
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

336
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:21,239
1939?!

337
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,298
This penny's from 1939!

338
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:29,090
A 67-year-old penny.

339
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:32,021
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

340
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:35,350
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

341
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:38,159
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

342
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:40,200
and this baby is worth
something to a collector.

343
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:42,349
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

344
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:44,651
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner

345
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,389
with the money I get
for this little guy.

346
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,860
And that's exactly what I did.

347
00:18:48,874 --> 00:18:52,479
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

348
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:55,548
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

349
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:59,099
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

350
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,618
1984.

351
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:04,430
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

352
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:05,990
How dare you.

353
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,900
Hey, what's going on?

354
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,590
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

355
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,091
Yeah, but for what?

356
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,288
It was me.

357
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:15,221
I started this.

358
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:17,150
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

359
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:20,030
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

360
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:22,489
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

361
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,449
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

362
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:27,668
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

363
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:29,929
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

364
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:32,089
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

365
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:34,111
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

366
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,630
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

367
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,711
And we would have
made our flight.

368
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:41,388
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

369
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:43,140
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

370
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,570
I wish I did.

371
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:46,468
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

372
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:49,170
losing a sweet penny like that.

373
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,048
Uh, sir?

374
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:53,758
Oh, please tell me you
have some good news.

375
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:55,571
Uh, I'm afraid not.

376
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,640
There are no extra
seats on the plane.

377
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:58,941
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,808
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

379
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:02,831
I can't believe this.

380
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:05,618
That's it, it's over.

381
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,141
Ted, come on.

382
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:10,530
Your destiny just wasn't to
make it to Chicago today.

383
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:13,479
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

384
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,351
But that's not what happened.

385
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:17,158
They didn't reschedule.

386
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:19,041
They hired someone else.

387
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,588
And as it turned out,
three months later,

388
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:24,881
that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.

389
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,271
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

390
00:20:27,283 --> 00:20:29,750
I thought I was destined
to get that job.

391
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,078
But I was wrong.

392
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,660
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

393
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:35,920
Because if I hadn't,

394
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,078
I never would have
met your mother.

395
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:09,029
