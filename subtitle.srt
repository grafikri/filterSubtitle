1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
Kids, in the spring of 2008
something kind of strange -

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,480
have been happening to your uncle Barney.
He's been doing great with a woman.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,880
So I threw the pressure
air oxygen into its mouth.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,560
I shoot the tank, boo, no more shark.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,880
Mr. Hall and I swam back to shell.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,480
- Hey, let me serve you a drink.
- He's only been gone a few moments -

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,200
- but when he return...
- So where were we?

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
- He gets slap! It kept happening...
- Jerk!

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,880
Until finally Lily was approached
by a mysterious woman -

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,080
who wants her stay away from Barney...

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,600
- So when it happened once more...
- Again? Really? Wait.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,080
Barney knew who to look for.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,400
Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you
and then totally screw you over?

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
No.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,560
What are you doing on Friday?

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,640
Hey! Uh... no.
Stop!

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,680
- Amy?
- Abby.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Right.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,080
How I Met Your Mother S03 E19

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,400
720p Sync and English error fixed By CycoMiko.
If you do it something? Do it fuckin' good!

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,360
Kids, sometimes you can do something
right a thousand times in a row...

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,480
A rainbow!

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
That's beautiful!

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
What a beautiful rainbow!

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,120
Another rainbow?

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,320
It's beautiful!

27
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,880
But then, that thousand-and-first time...

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,080
You're kidding me.
Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,920
Hey, how was your day?

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,120
Today, I yelled at a little girl
for painting a rainbow.

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,000
A rainbow?
Sounds like that bitch had it coming.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,840
So, uh, I just met with the contractor.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,840
and it turns out, that fixing the
floors of the new apartment -

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,200
- is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.
- But we can barely afford that to begin with.

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,400
I hate to say this,

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,000
but I think you're going to
have to sell your stuff.

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,480
Whoa! Marshall,
that's just a game we play in the bedroom.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,400
I mean your clothes.
All those designer pieces and everything.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,840
What?
Why just my clothes?

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
We can sell my stuff, too,
but I got to tell you,

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress
is going to go for a lot more

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,240
than my "Split Happens" bowling shirt.
I'm not selling that.

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,800
- I've already made the Website.
- You made a Website?

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,560
Yeah, it's called
"Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com."

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,120
No, you know what would be
a better name for the site?

46
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag-

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
for-the-next- three-years-dot-com.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,520
- That's real.
- I'm worried.

49
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,520
- That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.
- Hmm, but, girlfriend, -

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,360
you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.

51
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,520
Why are you trying to ruin my life?

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,040
Well, you slept with me and then
you never called me again.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,600
- And?
- That's it.

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120
That's it?
As far as I'm concerned, -

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,640
if I leave you safe on dry land
with adequate transportation home, -

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,560
- you've got nothing to complain about.
- Well, it hurt, okay?

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,880
And then Ted, the love of my life,
started dating my boss instead of me.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,840
- Do you know how that feels?
- Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,920
- Abby!
- Abby.

60
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,240
A few weeks ago,
Ted dumped me as his wingman.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You had a crush on him for a couple weeks?
I was Ted's best friend for seven years.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,760
- Ted said Marshall was his best friend.
- Seven years!

63
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,560
- Sorry.
- Ted.

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,720
What an idiot.
With his stupid -

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,520
"meaningful relationship" with Stella.

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,840
- Ted.
- Ted.

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,000
- I hate Ted.
- I hate Ted more.

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
- Are you as turned on as I am?
- Probably not quite as much.

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm sorry I yelled out "Ted."

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm sorry I yelled out "Abby."

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,520
I am Abby.

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,520
Oh, cool.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,320
This is insane.
Has Lily even worn half this stuff?

74
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,240
Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in
your closet you've never worn?

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,640
- As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.
- Whatever, red cowboy boots.

76
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,520
Those are nice boots.
I totally pull those off.

77
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
Hey, Lil,

78
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,360
if I were to say "Ted could never pull them off, "

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,800
- What would I be talking about?
- His red cowboy boots.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,840
I totally pull them off!
It's a classic Western look.

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,720
Oh, okay, uh, today's category:

82
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,200
classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots.

83
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,480
Ooh, ooh! Robin.

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,160
"The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous."

85
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
"The Magnificent Kevin."

86
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,440
"No Country for Straight Men."

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,280
I don't want to sell my clothes!

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
Oh, I know, sweetie.
Come here.

89
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,840
- Is this a hundred percent silk?
- Lily, listen, we really need the money.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
I have some leads on a job, but until then,

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,760
I just... I don't know what else we can do.

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,080
I'll sell my paintings!

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,560
- What?
- Yeah, I'll sell my paintings.

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
Good oil paintings go for like, $500.

95
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
Yeah.
Totally.

96
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,560
- But...
- Kids, sometimes you can do something right -

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,640
- a thousand times in a row...
- I love it.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
It's a masterpiece.

99
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,880
That's it. We're selling the TV. I just
want to come home and stare at this all day.

100
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,880
Somebody call the cops! My wife stole
an awesome painting from the museum!

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,960
But then, that thousand-and-first time...

102
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
That kind of money only
goes for real paintings.

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,040
What does that mean?

104
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,520
Look, it just, it just means -

105
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,720
that-that we need money right now
and I'm not sure that selling your paintings

106
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,120
- is-is how we're going to get it.
- You don't believe in me.

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,840
No, wait, wait!
Of c...

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,960
- Of course I believe in you!
- Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist.

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,520
My paintings are good.
I bet Robin would buy one.

110
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
What now?

111
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
I love your painting,
I just... I'm trying to be realistic.

112
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
Well, how much money do we need

113
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
- for the contractor to finish the job?
- About 1, 500 bucks.

114
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,720
Okay.

115
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,000
So, if I can sell three of my
paintings at 500 bucks a pop, -

116
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,680
- then I get to keep all my clothes.
- Babe, we need money fast.

117
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Well, give me a week.

118
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,040
- Okay, a-a week. Fine.
- Fine.

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Fine.

120
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,520
Pulling.

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
Them.

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Off.

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,160
Lily's first move on a
great art challenge of 2008 -

124
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,480
was to display one of her favorite
paintings ater friend's gallery.

125
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
The night didn't go so well.

126
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,520
- But then at the last minute...
- I love it.

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,880
- You do?
- Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous.

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,000
- Is that 100 % silk?
- It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!

129
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
So the next day,
Lily took her painting to a coffee house -

130
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,840
- that displayed local artists.
- We've been sitting here for hours

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,320
and nobody's even glanced at my painting.

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,680
Come on. Let's start talking it up.

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,160
Wow!

134
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,840
I really like that painting!

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,200
It's neat!
The-the colors are neat.

136
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,560
The-the shapes are neat.
It's really just...

137
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Neat.

138
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,960
- What?
- Observe.

139
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,600
I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork

140
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,000
that, combined with the fluid composition,

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,200
creates an almost Kandinsky-like
emotional resonance.

142
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,840
Yes, and you can still enjoy it

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
even if you're not a pretentious douche.

144
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,840
Can you clarify something
for me about your critique?

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,320
Are the colors "neat" or are
they more "neato burrito?"

146
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.

147
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
I pull these off!

148
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,920
I pull these off!

149
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,240
You know what I hate most about Ted?

150
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,720
- What?
- His stupid hair.

151
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,400
His stupid, lame awesome hair.

152
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,520
It's so stupid and awesome.

153
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,120
- You know what I hate most about Ted?
- What?

154
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,400
How he's always like, "Oh, I want to
fall in love and have a relationship.

155
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,040
I care about the people I have sex with."
He's so lame.

156
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
He's so lame and awesome.

157
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,200
You know what he needs?

158
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,400
He needs to see just how horrible he is
when he's in a relationship.

159
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,200
Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him.

160
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,400
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

161
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,720
- I think so.
- You're thinking of having sex with Ted?

162
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,720
After four days without selling a single painting,

163
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,600
- Lily was getting desperate.
- Painting for sale!

164
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
$500!

165
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,600
Lifelong dream hanging in the balance!

166
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,520
It's like they don't even see us.

167
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,160
Yeah, we're dirt to them.
What do you need money for?

168
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,760
Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood
floors in my new apartment.

169
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,520
- You?
- Heroin.

170
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,920
- Do you like heroin?
- Love it.

171
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,560
In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take
your money and go buy some more heroin.

172
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,480
Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy.

173
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
It's not very good.

175
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,840
And just as she was about to lose all hope,

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,520
something amazing happened.

177
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,640
Oh, my God!

178
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,040
500 bucks!
Who's a real painter now, Marshall?

179
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,400
- Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.
- Oh, I know, sweetie.

180
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,320
And since I'm a professional artist now,

181
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original,

182
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,640
you know, to say thanks
for being such a supportive husband.

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,400
I'm thinking about calling it...
"Suck It!"

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,200
Lily, come on.
I'm proud of you.

185
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,800
- Who-who bought it?
- Well, that's the best part.

186
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
A gay couple without kids.
A G-CWOK!

187
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,800
- You bagged a G-CWOK?
- Yeah, that's right.

188
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,320
They are the heart and soul of
the art-buying community.

189
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
You know what you should do?
You should call up the G-CWOKs -

190
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,440
and offer them a free painting
if they throw a private art party -

191
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,760
- for all their G-CWOK friends.
- That's an amazing idea.

192
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm going to go call them. I can probably
sell two more paintings with time to spare.

193
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,080
Oh, wait, Marshall.
There was something I had to tell you.

194
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,840
- What was it?
- Oh, that's right.

195
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Suck it.

196
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,720
Ted, fancy bumping into you here.

197
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?

198
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
Uh, yeah.
Hi, Abby.

199
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,760
Abby. So, uh,
s-so you guys are dating now?

200
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,160
That's right.

201
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,560
I am done with this whole being awesome thing.

202
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,440
Now I'm all about farmers' markets
and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts.

203
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,520
- Isn't that right, sweetie?
- That's right.

204
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,240
And girlfriends are lame.
Unless they're me.

205
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,560
- I miss you, Ted.
- Abby and I -

206
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,360
are in love.
Not hot passionate love.

207
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,200
Couple love. You know,
movie night with my girlfriend, -

208
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,920
then waiting for her to go to bed so I can
steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy -

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,680
by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.

210
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,040
We're showing Ted how lame he is.

211
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,640
You don't have to say it, though.

212
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,440
Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.

213
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,640
Stop what, Ted?
Stop being in love?

214
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.

215
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
We can't stop breathing, Ted.
Your hair looks amazing.

216
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,040
Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing.

217
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,440
- Please stop.
- Not before I share with you -

218
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,480
what being in a relationship leads to, Ted.

219
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
Abby,
Pookie Bear...

220
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,560
I am so pathetically desperate for you that...

221
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Aw, heck, I'll just say it.

222
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,800
- Will you marry me?
- Wait, really?

223
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,080
I would never joke about true love.

224
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,320
- Yes, I'll marry you.
- Okay.

225
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
Thank you, thank you.

226
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
I have to call my mom.

227
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,760
- That's you.
- Yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.

228
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,680
- Uh, yes, she does.
- It finally happened, Mama.

229
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,680
I just wish Daddy were alive
to walk me down the aisle.

230
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
Totally committed to the bit.

231
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,160
Yes, Lily Aldrin.
I sold you the painting earlier today.

232
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,960
Oh, honey, hello.

233
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
- You sound happy. - Are you kidding?
We're popping the champagne right now.

234
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,480
Well, I just wanted to offer
you an exclusive chance

235
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,720
to view some of my other paintings.

236
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh,
I guess I should have told you.

237
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,360
- We just bought that for the frame.
- What?

238
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah, it's an original Anton Kreutzer,
a very rare frame from the turn of the century.

239
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,080
So... y-you didn't like my painting?

240
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,320
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, no, not at all.

241
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,600
But you know, good for you.

242
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Okay.

243
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,760
Well, if you didn't want the painting,
can I... can I at least get it back?

244
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,080
Yeah, no, we don't have it anymore.

245
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
Where is it?

246
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,160
I see.

247
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,360
H-He threw out my painting.

248
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,080
Champagne for everyone on me,

249
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,760
the happiest guy in the world.

250
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:34,881
Ginger Ale, it's a bid.

251
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,200
This is great.
My dream of becoming an artist is dead, -

252
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,400
and now I'm watching
my wardrobe disappear -

253
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
piece by piece.

254
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,640
There goes my favorite dress.

255
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,200
- This dress meant a lot to me.
- Really?

256
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,840
Yeah.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,560
It was spring of 2004 and I had
been having a hard few months.

258
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,120
Day-am.

259
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,440
I got a two-syllable "damn" in this dress.

260
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,800
- A two-syllable "damn." That's the dream.
- Yeah.

261
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,160
Now she belongs to...
CanadaGirl@MetroNewsOne.com.

262
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
It's still in the family.

263
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,640
- Lily, you're not going to believe this.
Something amazing happened. - What?

264
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,080
- I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.
- Really? Why?

265
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,360
Because I felt guilty.
This auction was my idea -

266
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,520
and now you've had to sit around all day
while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart -

267
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
the carcass of your wardrobe.

268
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,520
It's still in the family.

269
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,760
And more importantly,

270
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,080
I honestly love that painting
and I couldn't stand to think of it -

271
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,280
- in a trashcan someplace.
- Well, what happened?

272
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,840
Well, hello.

273
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,840
Hi, um... Lawrence.

274
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,200
I-I'm here about the painting my wife
Lily sold you... the one in the nice frame.

275
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,600
Talk about a nice frame.

276
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,200
My, my, you are a big one, aren't you?
And you're married to that little bit of a thing.

277
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
How does that work?
I'd like to find out.

278
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
Yeah, we get it.
Gay guys like you.

279
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,320
No, Lily, they love me,
but that's not the important part.

280
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,760
Here's the important part.

281
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,680
Since you're clearly a man
of impeccable taste and style, -

282
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,280
I-I came down here to ask you:
what do you think of the boots?

283
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Walter.

284
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Boots.

285
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,400
Pulling.
Them.

286
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
Off.

287
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,360
I'll be in the cab.

288
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,280
- G-CWOK-approved.
- The painting.

289
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,560
Right, so, um, they told me they threw it

290
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,600
in the building's dumpster.
It wasn't in there,

291
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,840
but the super told me that
he'd seen one Dr. Greer...

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,160
a veterinarian who works in the building
take the painting out of the trash.

293
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
Dr. Greer?

294
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,040
Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?

295
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You're about to find out.

296
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,360
Long story short, I had to make a trash run.
Been a busy day... lots of neuterings.

297
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
- Ooh, we don't need the details.
- Oh, n-n-no, it's not what you think.

298
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,280
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah, yeah, mostly just dog testicles. Anyway...

299
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,840
I noticed your painting -

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,560
just sitting right there on top
and I thought, "Hey, free painting, "

301
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,920
so I brought it upstairs
and hung it up in Exam Room 3, -

302
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
and then the strangest thing happened.

303
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,440
Hey, Muffin.

304
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,960
Whoa, I think he remembers me
from the last time he was here.

305
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,080
Take Muffin to Exam Room 3.
I'll meet you there.

306
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,240
I went in, expecting the worst.

307
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,880
I'd never seen Muffin that calm,

308
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,120
and then a little later the
same thing happened again -

309
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,320
with Tidbit...

310
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,400
and King Larry...

311
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,560
and again with the Weinstein triplets.

312
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,200
Something about your art
speaks to the canine sensibility

313
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,080
- on a very primal level.
- Really?

314
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,440
- Dogs like my paintings?
- Yeah.

315
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,280
But you know who it bums out?
Birds.

316
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,800
Yeah.
Had a parrot in there today.

317
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,080
He took one look at it,
pried open his cage, -

318
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,320
flew right into the ceiling fan.

319
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,480
Anyway, because your first
painting worked so well, -

320
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,680
I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.

321
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,320
- Really? - Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.
- That's two grand.

322
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,800
- That's more than we need for the contractor.
- Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.

323
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
- In what?
- In you.

324
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,440
Marshall explained that he was
building a fancy new Web site -

325
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,920
specifically to sell Lily's
artwork to veterinarians.

326
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,120
Well, it's not exactly the clientele

327
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,720
I had in mind, but...
thank you for believing in me.

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,280
Man, birds do not get you.

329
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
- Hi, sweetie. - Hey, I think I left
my tie here. Have you seen it?

330
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,600
No, I'm in wedding-planning mode.

331
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Stressville. Population: me.
Okay, big decision.

332
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,920
What do you think the cake should be:
Fudge the Whale or Cookie Puss?

333
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,120
Yeah, that was a bit.

334
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,160
- We were doing a bit.
- So I'm thinking Labor Day.

335
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't
want to steal any attention away from America.

336
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,040
Abby, I've... I've got some bad news.

337
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,080
- I can't marry you.
- What?

338
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,520
Ted begged me not to.

339
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,520
- I think he's in love with you.
- Really?

340
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed.

341
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,040
You have to go to him.

342
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,440
Here's his home address.

343
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,360
But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't
go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

344
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,080
Oh, my God, thank you.
But now I feel wrong keeping this.

345
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,360
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.
That's made of candy.

346
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,280
Later.

347
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,800
Hey, go to
lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com

348
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,200
- or charityfolks.com.
- We're having an auction to rise money -

349
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,360
for the children's hospital of Los Angeles.

350
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,320
You could get tons of cool stuff on
the sell and they all use for great cost.

351
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,840
Thanks.

352
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,041
720p Sync and error fix by CycoMiko.
